== Altcoin
A clone of the Bitcoin Protocol with some modifications. Usually all altcoins have rules incompatible with Bitcoin Protocol and have their own genesis blocks.

The most notable altcoins are litecoin (uses faster block confirmation time and scrypt as a proof-of-work) and namecoin (has a special key-value storage).

In theory, an altcoin can be started from an existing Bitcoin Blockchain if someone wants to support a different set of rules (although, there is no such example to date).
