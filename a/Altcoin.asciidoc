== Altcoin

A clone of the link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin Protocol] with some modifications. Usually all altcoins have rules incompatible with the link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin Protocol] and have their own link:../g/Genesis_Block.asciidoc[genesis blocks].

The most notable altcoins are litecoin (uses faster block confirmation time and scrypt as a proof-of-work) and namecoin (has a special key-value storage).

In theory, an altcoin can be started from an existing Bitcoin link:../b/Blockchain.asciidoc[Blockchain] if someone wants to support a different set of rules (although, there is no such example to date).
