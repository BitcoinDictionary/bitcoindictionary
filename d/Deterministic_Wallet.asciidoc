== Deterministic Wallet
A deterministic wallet is a system of deriving keys from a single starting point known as a link:../s/Seed.asciidoc[seed]. The link:../s/Seed.asciidoc[seed] allows a user to easily back up and restore a link:../w/Wallet.asciidoc[wallet] without needing any other information and can in some cases allow the creation of link:../p/Public_Address.asciidoc[public addresses] without the knowledge of the link:../p/Private_Key.asciidoc[private key].
