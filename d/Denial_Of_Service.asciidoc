This is a form of attack on the network.

link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin] link:../n/Node.asciidoc[nodes] punish certain behaviour of other link:../n/Node.asciidoc[node] by banning their IP addresses for 24 hours to avoid DoS.

Also, some theoretical attacks like link:../f/Fifty-One_Percent_Attachk.asciidoc[51% attack] may be used for network-wide DoS.
