== Difficulty

Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new link:../b/Block.asciidoc[block] compared to the easiest it can ever be. By definition, it is a maximum link:../t/Target.asciidoc[target] divided by the current link:../t/Target.asciidoc[target].

Difficulty is used in two link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin] rules:

- Every block must be meet difficulty link:../t/Target.asciidoc[target] to ensure 10 minute interval between link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks] and - link:../t/Transacton.asciidoc[Transactions] are considered confirmed only when belonging to a link:../m/Main_Chain.asciidoc[main chain] which is the one with the biggest cumulative difficulty of all link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks].

As of September 5, 2013 the difficulty is 86 933 018 and grows by 20-30% every two weeks.
