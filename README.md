# Bitcoin Dictionary

The Bitcoin Dictionary is a collection of definitions of Bitcoin-related terms for the community of Bitcoin users, developers, businesses as well as anyone interested in Bitcoin.

As of now, there is no single authoritative source of standardised definition of the terms that the people in the Bitcoin community are continually coming up with. This project aims to solve this problem by putting the definition of all the Bitcoin related terms in one place.
