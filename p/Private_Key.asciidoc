== Private Key

A 256-bit number used in the ECDSA algorithm to create transaction signatures in order to prove ownership of certain amount of bitcoins.

It can also be used in arbitrary Elliptic Curve Arithmetic operations. Private keys are stored within wallet applications and are usually encrypted with a pass phrase. Private keys may be completely random (see Key Pool) or generated from a single secret number (“seed”).
