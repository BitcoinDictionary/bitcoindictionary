== Full Node

A link:../n/Node.asciidoc[node] which implements all of link:../b/Bicoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin protocol] and does not require trusting any external service to validate link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transactions]. It is able to download and validate the entire link:../b/Blockchain.asciidoc[blockchain]. All full nodes implement the same peer-to-peer messaging protocol to exchange link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transactions] and link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks], but that is not a requirement. A full node may receive and validate data using any protocol and from any source. However, the highest security is achieved by being able to communicate as fast as possible with as many link:../n/Node.asciidoc[nodes] as possible.
