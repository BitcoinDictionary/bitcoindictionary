A concept of adding a special meaning to certain link:../t/Transction_Output.asciidoc[transaction outputs]. This could be used to create a tradable commodity on top of the link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin protocol]. For instance, a company may create 1 million shares and declare a single link:../t/Transction_Output.asciidoc[transaction outputs] containing 10 link:../b/BTC.ascii[BTC] (1 billion link:../s/Satoshi.asciidoc[satoshis]) as a source of these shares. Then, some or all of these link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[bitcoins] can be moved to other link:../a/Address.asciidoc[addresses], sold or exchanged for anything. During a voting process or a dividend distribution, share owners can prove ownership by simply singing a particular message by the link:../Private_Key.asciidoc[private keys] associated with link:../a/Address.asciidoc[addresses] holding link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[bitcoins] derived from the initial source.
