== Confirmation Number

Confirmation number is a measure of probability that transaction could be rejected from the main chain.

“Zero confirmations” means that link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transaction] is unconfirmed (not in any block yet). One confirmation means that the link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transaction] is included in the latest block in the link:../m/Main_Chain.asciidoc[main chain]. Two confirmations means the link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transaction] is included in the link:../b/Block.asciidoc[block] right before the latest one. And so on.
