== Merkle Tree

Merkle tree is an abstract data structure that organises a list of data items in a tree of their hashes (like in Git, Mercurial or ZFS).

In Bitcoin the merkle tree is used only to organise transactions within a block (the block header contains only one hash of a tree) so that full nodes may prune fully spent transactions to save disk space.

SPV clients store only block headers and validate transactions if they are provided with a list of all intermediate hashes.
