== Main Chain

A part of the blockchain which a node considers the most difficult. All nodes store all valid blocks, including orphans and recompute the total difficulty when receiving another block.

If the newly arrived block or blocks do not extend the existing main chain, but create another one from some previous block, it is called reorganisation.
