== Unconfirmed Transaction

A transaction that is not included in any block. It's also known as a “0-confirmation” transaction.

Unconfirmed transactions are relayed by the nodes and stay in their mempools. An unconfirmed transaction stays in the pool until the node decides to:
- throw it away,
- finds it in the blockchain, or
- includes it in the blockchain itself (if it's a miner).
