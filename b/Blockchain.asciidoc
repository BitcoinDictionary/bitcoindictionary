== Blockchain

A public ledger of all link:../c/Confirmed_Transaction.asciidoc[confirmed transactions] in a form of a tree of all valid link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks] (including link:../o/Orphan.asciidoc[orphans]). Most of the time, “blockchain” means the link:../m/Main_Chain.asciidoc[main chain], a single most link:../d/Difficulty.asciidoc[difficult] chain of link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks].

The Blockchain is updated by link:../m/Mining.asciidoc[mining] link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks] with new link:../t/Transaction.asciidoc[transactions]. link:../u/Unconfirmed_Transaction.asciidoc[Unconfirmed transactions] are not part of the blockchain. If some link:../c/Client.asciidoc[clients] disagree on which chain is main or which link:../b/Block.asciidoc[blocks] are valid, a link:../f/Fork.asciidoc[fork] happens.
