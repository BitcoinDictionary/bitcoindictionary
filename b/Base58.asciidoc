== Base58

A compact human-readable encoding for binary data invented by link:../s/Satoshi_Nakamoto.asciidoc[Satoshi Nakamoto] to make more user-friendly link:../a/Address.asciidoc[addresses]. It consists of alphanumeric characters, but does not allow “0”, “O”, “I”, “l” characters that look the same in some fonts and could be used to create visually identical looking addresses. Lowercase “o” and “1” are allowed.
