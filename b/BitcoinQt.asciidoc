== BitcoinQt

link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin] implementation based on original code by link:../s/Satoshi_Nakamoto.asciidoc[Satoshi Nakamoto]. Includes a graphical interface for Windows, OS X and Linux (using QT) and a command-line executable link:../b/BitcoinD.asciidoc[BitcoinD] that is typically used on servers.

It is considered a reference implementation as it's the most used link:../f/Full_Node.asciidoc[full node] implementation, especially among link:../m/Miner.asciidoc[miners]. Other implementations must be bug-for-bug compatible with it to avoid being link:../f/Fork.asciidoc[forked]. BitcoinQT uses OpenSSL for its link:../e/ECDSA.asciidoc[ECDSA] operations which has its own quirks that became a part of the standard (e.g. non-canonically encoded link:../p/Public_Key.asciidoc[public keys] are accepted by OpenSSL without an error, so other implementations must do the same).
