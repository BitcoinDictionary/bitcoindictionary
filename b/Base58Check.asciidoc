== Base58Check

A variant of link../b/Base58.asciidoc[Base58] encoding that appends first 4 bytes of link:../h/Hash256.asciidoc[Hash256] of the encoded data to that data before converting to link../b/Base58.asciidoc[Base58]. It is used in link:../a/Address.asciidoc[addresses] to detect typing errors.
