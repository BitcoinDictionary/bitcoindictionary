== Stale

When a bitcoin block is successfully hashed, any others attempting to hash it may as well stop, because it is now â€˜stale'. They would simply be repeating work that someone else has already done, for no reward. The term is also used in mining pools to describe a share of a hashing job that has already been completed.
