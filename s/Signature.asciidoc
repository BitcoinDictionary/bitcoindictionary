== Signature

A sequence of bytes that proves that a piece of data is acknowledged by a person holding a certain public key. Bitcoin uses [ECDSA] for signing transactions. Amounts of bitcoins are sent through a chain of transactions: from one to another. Every transaction must provide a signature matching a public key defined in the previous transaction. This way only a proper owner a secret private key associated with a given public key can spend bitcoins further.
