== Spent Output

A transaction output can be spent only once: when another valid transaction makes a reference to this output from its own input.

When another transaction attempts to spend the same output, it will be rejected by the nodes already seeing the first transaction. The blockchain as a proof-of-work scheme allows every node to agree on which transaction was indeed the first one. The whole transaction is considered spent when all its outputs are spent.
