== Standard Transaction

Some transactions are considered standard, meaning they are relayed and mined by most nodes.

More complex transactions could be buggy or cause DoS attacks on the network, so they are considered non-standard and not relayed or mined by most nodes. Both standard and non-standard transactions are valid and once included in the blockchain, will be recognised by all [Node|[nodes]].

Standard transactions are:
1. sending to a public key,
2. sending to an address,
3. sending to a P2SH address,
4. sending to an m-of-n multi-signature transaction where N is 3 or less.
