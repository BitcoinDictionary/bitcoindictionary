== Script

A compact turing-incomplete programming language used in transaction inputs and outputs.

Scripts are interpreted by a Forth-like stack machine: each operation manipulates data on the stack. Most scripts follow the standard pattern and verify the digital signature provided in the transaction input against a public key provided in the previous transaction's output. Both signatures and public keys are provided using scripts.

Scripts may contain complex conditions, but can never change amounts being transferred. Amount is stored in a separate field in a transaction output.
