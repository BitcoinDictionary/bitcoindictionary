== Hash160

SHA-256 hashed with RIPEMD-160. It is used to produce an address because it makes a smaller hash (20 bytes vs 32 bytes) than SHA-256, but still uses SHA-256 internally for security.

It's known as BTCHash160() in CoreBitcoin, Hash160() in BitcoinQt. It is also available in scripts as OP_HASH160.
