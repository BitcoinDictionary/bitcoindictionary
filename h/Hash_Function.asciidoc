== Hash Function

The Bitcoin protocol mostly uses two cryptographic hash functions: SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. The first one is almost exclusively used in the two round hashing (Hash256), while the latter one is only used in computing an address (see also Hash160).

Scripts may use not only Hash256 and Hash160, but also SHA-1, SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160.
