== Transaction

A chunk of binary data that describes how bitcoins are moved from one owner to another. Transactions are stored in the blockchain.

Every transaction (except for coinbase transactions) has a reference to one or more previous transactions (inputs) and one or more rules on how to spend these bitcoins further (outputs).
