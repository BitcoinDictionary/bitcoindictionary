== Transaction Output

An output contains an amount to be sent and a script that allows further spending. The script typically contains a public key (or an address, a hash of a public key) and a signature verification opcode.

Only an owner of a corresponding private key is able to create another transaction that sends that amount further to someone else.

In every transaction, the sum of output amounts must be equal or less than a sum of all input amounts.
