== 51% attack

A condition in which more than half the computing power on a cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single miner or group of miners.
That amount of power theoretically makes them the authority on the network.
This means that every client on the network believes the attackerâ€™s hashed transaction block.
This gives them control over the network, including the power to:
- Issue a transaction that conflicts with someone else's.
- Stop someone else's transaction from being confirmed.
- Spend the same coins multiple times.
- Prevent other miners from mining valid blocks.
