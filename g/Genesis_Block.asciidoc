== Genesis Block

The very first link:../b/Block.asiidoc[block] in the link:../b/Blockchain.ascii[blockchain] with hard-coded contents and an all-zero reference to a previous link:../b/Block.asiidoc[block]. The Genesis block was released on 3rd of January 2009 with a newspaper quote in its link:../c/Coinbase.asciidoc[coinbase]: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” as a proof that there are no secretly link:../m/Mining.asciidoc[pre-mined] link:../b/Block.asiidoc[blocks] to overtake the link:../b/Blockchain.asciidoc[blockchain] in the future. The message ironically refers to a reason for link:../b/Bitcoin.asciidoc[Bitcoin] existence: a constant inflation of money supply by governments and banks.
